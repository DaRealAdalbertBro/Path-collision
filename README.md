# AI Path Collision - Usage

**Interval** = Minimum & maximum number of steps to start & end path collision analysis.
<br>
**track1**, **track2** = Paths in a world direction format.

## Example:
```
100-900
50W,46N,150E,127S,316E,770S,343E,825N,654W,209S,211W
593E,112N,903E,873N,93E
```

Imagine that 2 cars are driving on some designated track. The first car moves 50 "blocks" west, 46 north, and so on as the second car. The two cars know each other and want to go to lunch between a given time (that's the interval), so they arrange to meet in the town they're both passing through. Today, they can meet in the 100 (X), 0 (Y) coordination on the map.
